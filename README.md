# ApanoMerites-AndroidStudioApp
 Android Studio App - Java - Google Maps API - Geofence - Quiz Game

# Overview 
<p>The project is aimed at developing an Android Studio App that serves as an assignment for the course "Studio 7A - Interactive Systems Design" of the Department of Products and Systems Engineering of Aegean University.</p>
<p>The ApanoMerites app is an interactive application aiming to promote pro-environmental behavior in the protected area of Apano Meria. The implementing body of the interactive system is KoinSep 'Apano Meria', which is engaged in the protection and promotion of the environmental and human wealth of the area. The interactive application consists of one application for visitors of Apano Meria and one application for locals. The visitor's application includes information about areas in Apano Meria, activities (tasks), and collecting points and badges. The locals' application includes a system for verifying the completion of activities. The goal of the system is user learning, contribution to the local community, and, through this, connecting the visitor with it. Furthermore, the entire process is competitive, with users collecting points and badges that are later exchanged for offers at the 'Apano Meria' KoinSep store.</p>
<p>As part of the prototype creation, a route and an activity were implemented. The activity we selected is the transfer of bee food (vanillas) on the route from Kampos to Lia. Two user evaluations were conducted on this activity, one of which was onsite. Following the evaluations, the design team recorded future proposals for improving the system.</p>
